REAL-TIME LASSA VIRUS SEQUENCING IN NIGERIA, 2019

Repository for alignments, trees and BEAST 1.10 XML files associated with metagenomic sequencing during the Nigeria 2019 Lassa fever outbreak. This work resulted from a collaboration between the Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital (ISTH), Edo State, Nigeria; Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine (BNITM), Hamburg, Germany; Rega Institute / KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium; the ARTIC network; Public Health England (PHE), UK, and other partners.

Files with the '2019-19' tag correspond to the first batch of 19 sequences being released, with the analyses shown in the following virological post: [http://virological.org/t/2019-lassa-virus-sequencing-in-nigeria/287](http://virological.org/t/2019-lassa-virus-sequencing-in-nigeria/287).

Files with the '2019-32' and '2019-42' tags correspond to the second batch of 32 sequences being released. Note that for 10 of these, only the S segment is available, hence the difference in file names.
